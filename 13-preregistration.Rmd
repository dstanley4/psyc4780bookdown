## Overview

It's helpful to distinguish between preregistration and registered reports. This week we see a series of video that describe each of these approaches  One of the most population options for preregistering a study is to use the Open Science Framework (OSF) which was created by the Center for Open Science (COS). In this video you obtain an overview of preregistration and the OSF. Click on the still image from the video to play it.
